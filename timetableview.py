Module for Timetable View mapping and JSON Serialization

This module defines classes for representing timetable views in the Nextjs app. It also and provides functions
to convert these classes into raw JSON.

Classes:
- TimeTableView: Represents a timetable for multiple students.
- StudentView: Represents a specific student's timetable.
- TermView: Represents a term within a specific student's timetable.
- CourseView: Represents a course in specific student's timetable.
- CourseDateView: Represents a course date for a specific student's timetable

Functions:
- map_week_days(date_obj): Maps week days to date objects starting from Sunday.
- create_json(solution, objects): Creates a JSON representation of the SAT solver's timetable solution.
