### How To Create Custom Test Cases
 **Identify Required Data**: 
  Determine the necessary courses, course sections, and course requirements.

- **Create Student Data**: 
  In `students.json`, create the student profiles, making sure to include course wish lists and completed courses.

- **Gather Course Data**: 
  Utilize the course code's from the student's course data, extract matching courses from `reference/courses.json` and add them to the `courses.json` .

- **Select Section Data**: 
  Match the course code from the student's course data and extract matching sections for each term from `reference/sections.json` and add them to the `sections.json`.

- **Compile Requirements**: 
  Extract requirements from `reference/requirements.json` or create new requirements and add them to the  `requirements.json`.

- **Create Sub-files**: 
  Save the `.json` files and update the `tests.config.json` in your root project folder with your newly created test case.

### tests.config.json

Predefined test data sets are defined in the to the `tests.config.json` in the root project directory.

- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the test.
- **`test`**: A name for the test.
- **`description`**: A description of the test.
- **`location`**: The location of the test data set.

***Example:***
```json
[
    {   
        "id": 0,
        "test": "test-set-01",
        "description": "An example test data set",
        "location": "data/testing/test-data-set"
    }
]
```
