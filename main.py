    Create a data layer by loading the JSON configuration file and mapping data from the files listed in the configuration file.

    This function loads the JSON configuration file, which specifies the file paths
    for courses, buildings, and sections data. It then maps the data from these files
    to corresponding data structures, such as Course, Department, and CourseSection objects,
    using functions provided by the 'datalayer' module.

        None
